For getting citation data, not only do as the instructions in the README.md.
But also we need go to setting, repository - settings - code and automation -
Actions - general - Workflow permissions, choose the 'read and write
permission'

In addition, sometimes the build cannot regoginize the git user.name and
user.email properly, we can add several lines to specify your own user.name and
user.emai in the ./.github/workflows/google_scholar_crawler.yaml

Currently, there are no openings for perspective students, postdocs, or visitors that can be supported by my own grants.
However, if you are eligible for any other scholarships, you are welcome to contact me to discuss potential projects.
For example, for Chinese researchers, you can apply for the CSC scholarship; we can also host applications for the MSCA of the European Union, Juan de la Cierva programs of the Spanish government, and more.

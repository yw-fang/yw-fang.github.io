# <a id="openings"></a> ðŸ“– For perspective students, postdoc and visitors
Currently, there are no openings for perspective students, postdoc and visitors that can be supported by my own grants.
However, if you are eligible to any other scholarships, you are welcome to contact me to discuss potential projects.
For example, for Chinese researchers, you can apply for the CSC scholarship; we can also host the applications for MSCA of European Union, Juan de la Cierva programs of the Spanish government, and so on.
